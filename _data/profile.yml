bio: |
  AI Researcher with 5+ years of experience developing scalable machine learning frameworks for modeling complex scientific data in biomedical and clinical domains. Research focuses on representation learning from high-dimensional biological sequences and literature through algorithmic approaches including large language models, transformer-based architectures, and multi-agent reasoning systems. Led the design of extensible alignment frameworks and domain-specific information extraction models for large-scale scientific discovery tasks. Experienced in building generalizable AI systems that bridge machine learning, natural language processing, and computational biology to enable data-driven hypothesis generation and predictive modeling. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, and C/C++ for developing research-grade AI infrastructure.

research_interests: |
  I am dedicated to exploring how to (1) enable AI systems with knowledge and reasoning skills to solve biomedical tasks; and (2) develop scalable machine learning frameworks for biological sequence analysis.
  
  1) AI for Biomedical Discovery  
  I explore how AI can _assist and automate_ the scientific workflow in biomedical domains.
  * Fine-tuned LLMs: Adapt large language models for biomedical applications using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA.
  * Biomedical NLP: Build systems for named entity recognition and information extraction from scientific literature.
  * Multi-agent reasoning: Develop multi-agent systems for evidence-based drug discovery and scientific inquiry.
  * Knowledge integration: Combine parametric and retrieved knowledge for biomedical question answering and hypothesis generation.

  2) Biological Sequence Analysis  
  I aim to build _extensible frameworks_ for biological sequence alignment and analysis across scales.
  * Multi-scale alignment: Develop general algorithmic frameworks for sequence alignment.
  * K-mer methods: Explore k-mer signature-based approaches for early cancer screening, microbiome analysis and biomarker discovery.
  * Omics pipelines: Create industry-level, scalable pipelines for high-throughput omics data analysis and integrative modeling.
research_trajectory: |
  My research develops AI-driven computational systems that translate biological sequencing data into clinically actionable therapeutic insights through an end-to-end precision medicine pipeline:
  Sequencing → Representation Learning → Clinical Inference → Therapeutic Reasoning → In-Silico Screening.
  I build scalable frameworks to extract disease-associated molecular patterns from large-scale microbiome and genomic sequencing data, learn patient-specific biological representations, integrate molecular evidence with biomedical knowledge for clinical outcome prediction, and support treatment hypothesis generation through AI-driven reasoning. 
  My long-term goal is to enable integrative AI systems for early cancer detection and personalized treatment in precision oncology.
